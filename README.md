ML Homework2 Description : 
Naive Bayes classifier Create a Naive Bayes classifier for each handwritten digit that support discrete and continuous features.

Input:
1. Training image data from MNIST
   You Must download the MNIST from this website and parse the data by yourself. (Please do not use the build in dataset or you'll not get 100.)
   
   Please read the description in the link to understand the format.
   
   Basically, each image is represented by 28*28*8 bits (Whole binary file is in big endian format; you need to deal with it), you can use "char" arrary to store an image. 
   
   There are some headers you need to deal with as well, please read the link for more details.

3. Training lable data from MNIST.
4. Testing image from MNIST
5. Testing label from MNIST
6. Toggle option

   0: discrete mode
   
   1: continuous mode
